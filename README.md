# Human Autonomous Implantable System

Continuous calcium monitoring has potential uses therapeutics and diagnostics. However, there is no current method for doing so. Instead, clinicians rely on blood tests that may include a considerable amount of error. In this paper we propose a novel implantable device that can wirelessly transmit ionized calcium concentration measurements continuously. This device has the potential to improve existing therapies, enable new ones, and reduce healthcare costs.

# Biomechanics Research Proposal

Achilles tendon ruptures (ATRs) are the most common tendon tear in the human body and affect countless patients every year. However, in the NFL, the number of players suffering ATR each year has grown 300% to 500% in the past 25 years, leading researchers to believe that there may be another factor heightening the risk of ATR for these high performance athletes. Ankle tape is worn religiously by NFL athletes every week, and while it does have proven stabilizing benefits for the ankle, it may shorten the effective length of the tendon through compression. Ankle taping has also been found to limit dorsiflexion of the ankle and time to peak force in the lower extremities.
The purpose of this proposed study is to take a cohort of offensive and defensive players from the Stanford men’s football team and measure the strain experienced by the achilles tendon under force for both taped and untaped ankles.

# Photonics

I designed a multi-layer anti-reflective coating for a tandem perovskite-silicon PV cell utilizing using transfer matrix optimization. While a conventional p-n junction solar cell achieves a maximum efficiency of around 33% (with reference to the black-body radiation the cell receives from the sun), I demonstrated that with a perovskite layer, ITO layer, and 2 anti-reflective layers (of specified thicknesses), we could gain a theoretical efficiency of above 60%. While this may not be practically feasible, given non-ideal characteristics of manufacturing and materials, my paper demonstrates the kinds of innovations that are most “forward-looking” for companies and researches in photovoltaics.

# US Patent Final Report

This is the final term paper for ME 220. It is in the form of a patent application; as the product discussed below is novel and this format is effective in delineating its design. This application describes a design for a stove top frying pan (or pot) that simply determines the current temperature of its surface. As a matter of practicality, the design also includes a Peltier module that acts as a thermogenerator so that the pan can power itself.

# RF Communications

In my RF communications lab class, my lab partner and I devised a multi-channel walkie-talkie that works over 13.56 MHz ISM band. We designed a Gilbert-cell, run non-differentially, that worked for both up and down conversion, a quarter-wave segment that allowed for both transmission and reception, and various amplifier and filter stages. We created a schematic and layout – for the sake of the class we tested our design by laying out our components on perf board using copper tape to create a working set of transceivers that communicated over a short range.

# Resonant Power Converter

The requirements for the final project of EE365A are to create a resonant converter that is able to
1. Deliver 25 W of DC power
2. Operate at 6.78 MHz
3. Utilize a minimum input of 20V
4. Transmit power wirelessly (1 in)

# Information Theory and Data Compression Poster Presentation

I conducted research with Professor Tsachy Weissman in the Stanford Engineering Department during the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on human-inspired data compression. The shift to virtual platforms created a new need to support live performing arts and effective remote communication. I interviewed dozens of actors, musicians, and teachers to understand the challenges they faced in adapting to digital formats. I presented my findings to a group of peers and professors, emphasizing the importance of developing more efficient, human-centered communication technologies utilizing non-perfict midi audio recordings.

# On-site Interveiw Presentation

This is a presentation prepared for the on-site portion of the SpaceX interview process. I incorporated the final project done for EE 365A (above) and my intern project at De-Ice inc. (2023).
