I designed a multi-layer anti-reflective coating for a tandem perovskite-silicon PV cell utilizing using transfer matrix optimization. While a conventional p-n junction solar cell achieves a maximum efficiency of around 33% (with reference to the black-body radiation the cell receives from the sun), I demonstrated that with a perovskite layer, ITO layer, and 2 anti-reflective layers (of specified thicknesses), we could gain a theoretical efficiency of above 60%. While this may not be practically feasible, given non-ideal characteristics of manufacturing and materials, my paper demonstrates the kinds of innovations that are most “forward-looking” for companies and researches in photovoltaics.
