# Human Autonomous Implantable System

Continuous calcium monitoring has potential uses therapeutics and diagnostics. However, there is no current method for doing so. Instead, clinicians rely on blood tests that may include a considerable amount of error. In this paper we propose a novel implantable device that can wirelessly transmit ionized calcium concentration measurements continuously. This device has the potential to improve existing therapies, enable new ones, and reduce healthcare costs.

# Photonics

I designed a multi-layer anti-reflective coating for a tandem perovskite-silicon PV cell utilizing using transfer matrix optimization. While a conventional p-n junction solar cell achieves a maximum efficiency of around 33% (with reference to the black-body radiation the cell receives from the sun), I demonstrated that with a perovskite layer, ITO layer, and 2 anti-reflective layers (of specified thicknesses), we could gain a theoretical efficiency of above 60%. While this may not be practically feasible, given non-ideal characteristics of manufacturing and materials, my paper demonstrates the kinds of innovations that are most “forward-looking” for companies and researches in photovoltaics.

# US Patent Final Report

This is the final term paper for ME 220. It is in the form of a patent application; as the product discussed below is novel and this format is effective in delineating its design. This application describes a design for a stove top frying pan (or pot) that simply determines the current temperature of its surface. As a matter of practicality, the design also includes a Peltier module that acts as a thermogenerator so that the pan can power itself.

# RF Communications

In my RF communications lab class, my lab partner and I devised a multi-channel walkie-talkie that works over 13.56 MHz ISM band. We designed a Gilbert-cell, run non-differentially, that worked for both up and down conversion, a quarter-wave segment that allowed for both transmission and reception, and various amplifier and filter stages. We created a schematic and layout – for the sake of the class we tested our design by laying out our components on perf board using copper tape to create a working set of transceivers that communicated over a short range.
